Problem Statement: Automate Azure Virtual Network Deployment

Background: Your organization is expanding its cloud infrastructure on Azure and aims to establish a well-architected virtual network to support various services. The manual creation of these networks is time-consuming and prone to errors. Therefore, there is a need to automate the deployment of Azure Virtual Networks using Terraform.

Objectives:
Virtual Network Topology: Design Terraform configurations to define the structure of the Azure Virtual Network. This includes the creation of subnets, each serving a specific purpose (e.g., web, application, database), and the assignment of appropriate IP address ranges.
Security Groups and Network Security Rules: Implement Terraform scripts to set up network security groups (NSGs) and associated security rules. Define rules that control inbound and outbound traffic to and from the various subnets, ensuring a secure network environment.
Scaling and Redundancy: Incorporate scalability and redundancy considerations into the Terraform configurations. This may involve setting up multiple regions, each with its own virtual network, and establishing network connectivity between them.
ExpressRoute or VPN Connectivity: If applicable, design Terraform scripts to automate the provisioning of ExpressRoute or VPN connections for secure on-premises connectivity. Configure the necessary parameters, such as shared key and routing settings.
Naming Conventions and Tagging: Define and enforce naming conventions for resources within the virtual network. Utilize Terraform to implement consistent naming and tagging practices, facilitating better resource management and identification.
Integration with Azure Monitor: Ensure integration with Azure Monitor for logging and monitoring network activities. Leverage Terraform to set up monitoring configurations, such as diagnostic logs and metrics, providing insights into the virtual network's performance.
Deliverables:
Terraform scripts for automated deployment of Azure Virtual Network.
Detailed documentation describing the virtual network topology, security configurations, and any additional considerations.
Demonstration of the successful creation and scaling of the virtual network using Terraform.
Success Criteria:
Successfully deploy Azure Virtual Network resources using Terraform.
Establish secure communication between subnets through NSGs and security rules.
Implement scalability and redundancy measures as defined in the Terraform scripts.
Enable monitoring and logging for the virtual network through Azure Monitor integration.
